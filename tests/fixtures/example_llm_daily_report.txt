Hello Bob, here's a summary of your tasks for tomorrow:

- **Send an email to the marketing team about the campaign launch.** You need to take care of this first thing in the morning. I can assist you in drafting or sending this email.
- **Prepare the presentation for the client meeting.** Make sure your presentation includes the latest sales figures and project timelines.
- **Review the contract proposal from the new supplier.** Ensure that you check the terms for any discrepancies and prepare any questions you might have for them.

These are your priority tasks for tomorrow. Let me know if you need help drafting that email to the marketing team or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
